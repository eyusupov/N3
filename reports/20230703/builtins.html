		<h3>N3 builtins</h3>
		<p><abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr> defines a core set of <dfn data-lt="builtin">builtins</dfn>: these are
			predicates
			with pre-defined semantics for querying, manipulating and reasoning over <a>N3 documents</a>.
			Builtins are grouped into distinct vocabularies depending on the <a>N3 triple elements</a> they operate on
			(e.g., string, list),
			or their particular topic (e.g., time, cryptography, log).
			Builtins are denoted by a controlled IRI defined in one of the core builtin namespaces:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../ns/crypto.html">Crypto</a> –
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/crypto#">http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/crypto#</a>,
			</li>
			<li><a href="../ns/list.html">List</a> –
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/list#">http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/list#</a>,
			</li>
			<li><a href="../ns/log.html">Log</a> –

			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A builtin definition is structured as follows:
		<ul>
			<li><b>schema</b>: set of <a>arguments</a> defined in terms of the <a>N3 triple elements</a> in a builtin
				statement for which they act as placeholders.</li>
			<li><b>domain</b>: expected <a>domain datatypes</a> for the builtin arguments. Casting may take place if the
				<a>value datatype</a> does not correspond to the domain datatype.</li>
			<li><b>inputs and outputs</b>: <a>input arguments</a> and <a>output arguments</a>.</li>
			<li><b>summary</b>: a human-readable summary of the function of the builtin.</li>
		</ul>

		We define these concepts in more detail below.
		</p>

		<section id="builtins_args">
			<h4>Input and output arguments</h4>
			<p>An N3 <a>builtin</a> operates on its arguments. An <dfn>argument</dfn> is a placeholder that refers to an
				<a>N3 triple element</a> from the <dfn>builtin statement</dfn>, i.e., the <a>N3 statement</a> where the
				builtin acts as a predicate.</p>
			<p>In the simplest case, there are two arguments that respectively refer to the subject and object of the
				builtin statement. For instance, statements such as `1 math:lessThan 2` are true if the subject is less
				than the object. Hence, builtin `math:lessThan` has two arguments `$a_1` and `$a_2`, which is written as
				follows: `$a_1 math:lessThan $a_2`. (In this section, arguments are prefixed with `$a`.)</p>
			<p>Arguments can be also represent a "deconstruction" of the subject or object in case of lists or cited
				formulas. For instance, `(1 2 3) math:sum 6` calculates the sum of a list of numbers. Hence, the builtin
				`math:sum` has arguments `$a_1` .. `$a_n` and `$a_sum`, which is written as follows: `($a_1 .. $a_n)
				math:sum $a_sum`. </p>
			<p>In a builtin statement, if an argument refers to a concrete <a>N3 triple element</a> (i.e., either a
				concrete literal or a bound variable) within the builtin statement, we call its referent a builtin
				<dfn>input</dfn>, else, we call its referent a builtin <dfn>output</dfn>.
			<p>In some cases, an N3 builtin will only support outputs for one argument:
				e.g., `math:sum` only supports outputs for `$a_sum`.
				In other cases, an N3 builtin only supports inputs for all arguments:
				e.g., `math:lessThan` only supports inputs for `$a_1` and `$a_2`.
				In rarer cases, an N3 builtin can support outputs for several arguments:
				e.g., for `35 math:cos ?x`, the `math:cos` of `35` will be calculated; for `?x math:cos 0.57` the
				inverse operation (`math:acos`) for `0.57` will be calculated.
			</p>
			<p>The set of arguments, and whether they are allowed to have inputs or outputs, are defined per N3 builtin.
				An argument that is allowed to have output referents is called an <dfn>output argument</dfn>; otherwise,
				it is called an <dfn>input argument</dfn>.</p>
			<p class="ednote">The choice of allowing an argument as output is typically dictated by the need to avoid an
				infinite amount of results, intractable calculations, and general constraints that weigh utility vs.
				implementation difficulty.<br /><br />
				For instance, it would be perfectly possible to allow a single operand argument in `math:sum` to be an
				output in case the result argument is an input (e.g., `(1 ?o 3) math:sum 6`) &mdash; but this
				complicates the implementation of the builtin while offering only limited utility.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="builtin_arg_domains">
			<h4>Argument domains</h4>
			<p>An N3 builtin has an expected datatype for its arguments, called the <dfn>domain datatype</dfn>. If the
				datatype of an argument referent or value, called the <dfn>value datatype</dfn>, does not match the
				domain datatype, it may be possible to cast the value's datatype to, or substitute it for, the domain
				datatype.</p>
			<p>The expected datatypes of arguments, i.e., domain datatypes, are defined per N3 builtin.</p>
			<p>If the <a>value datatype</a> and <a>domain datatype</a> do not match, and no casting or substitution is
				possible, the builtin statement will be considered false. (This is in line with the concept of the
				builtin <a>theory box</a>: a BPG search using the builtin statement will not match any statement in the
				theory box when literal datatypes do not match.</p>

			<section>
				<h5>Numeric datatype promotion and substitution</h5>
				<p>If the numeric <a>value datatype</a> does not match the <a>domain datatype</a>, it may be possible to
					promote or substitute the numeric value datatype:</p>

				<p><b>Numeric type promotion</b>: A numeric value datatype that <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dt-derived">is derived from</a> the domain datatype can
					be promoted to the latter (e.g., `xs:integer` is derived from `xs:decimal`). This is done by casting
					the original value to the required datatype.</p>
				<p>If there is no direct derivation relation between the value and domain datatype, the following
					numeric type promotions can take place:
				<ul>
					<li>A value of type `xs:float` (or any type derived from `xs:float`) can be promoted to type
						`xs:double`. The result is an `xs:double` value that is the same as the original value.</li>
					<li>A value of type `xs:decimal` (or any type derived from `xs:decimal`) can be promoted to either
						of the types `xs:float` or `xs:double`.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p><b>Numeric type substitution</b>: If <i>all values</i> have the same numeric datatype, and this
					datatype <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dt-derived">is derived from</a> the domain
					datatype (e.g., `xs:integer` is derived from `xs:decimal`), then the values can be used without any
					casting. For example, if two `xs:integer` values are used for input where `xs:decimal` domains are
					expected, then the values retain their datatype as `xs:integer`. The substituted numeric datatype
					(in this case, `xs:integer`) will also apply to the builtin's output, if any.</p>

				<p><b>builtins operating on any numeric type</b>: some N3 builtins (e.g., `math:sum`) operate on values
					of any numeric type (i.e., `xs:numeric`, the union of `xs:double`, `xs:float`, and `xs:decimal`).
					I.e., their concrete input values may present any combination of numeric types. In that case, the
					builtin can only be applied if all value datatypes can be promoted into <i>a common numeric
						datatype</i> in the ordered list `(xs:integer, xs:decimal, xs:float, xs:double)`. If so, at that
					point, we rely on numeric type substitution. For instance:
				<ul>
					<li>For a builtin with `xs:numeric` domain datatypes, given two value datatypes `xs:integer` and
						`xs:decimal`, the `xs:integer` value will be promoted to `xs:decimal` as the common numeric
						datatype. At that point, the two `xs:decimal` datatypes can be substituted for `xs:numeric`
						(numeric type substitution). If the builtin has an output, then the calculated value for this
						output will also have datatype `xs:decimal`.</li>
					<li>For a builtin with `xs:numeric` domain datatypes, given two values with datatype `xs:integer`,
						the `xs:integer` datatype will simply be substituted for `xs:numeric`. If the builtin has an
						output, then the calculated value for the output will also have datatype `xs:integer`.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>Other kinds of datatype casting</h5>

				<p>If the non-numeric <a>value datatype</a> does not match the <a>domain datatype</a>, it may be
					possible to cast the value datatype to the domain datatype:</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h6>String</h6>
				<p>A literal will be considered a "string" when it has an `xs:string` datatype, a `rdf:langString`
					datatype due to the presence of a language tag, or when it lacks a datatype.</p>

				<p><b>Casting from string</b>: if an input value has an `xs:string` datatype that does not match the
					domain, it may be possible to cast the string to the domain datatype, as <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#casting-from-strings">defined in XPath</a>. The
					resulting value representation must be a valid lexical form for the domain datatype.</p>
				<p><b>Casting to string</b>: if an input value is an IRI, or any kind of literal (incl. type `xs:anyUri`
					or its derivations), and the domain is `xs:string`, then the value will be cast to a string as <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#casting-to-string">defined in XPath</a> along with
					additional rules <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#FunctionMapping">defined for SPARQL
						1.1</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h6>Other datatypes</h6>

				<p>Other types of datatype casting may take place as <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#casting">defined in XPath</a>.

				<p class="ednote">There is a useful chart for casting primitive types to primitive types in <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#casting-from-primitive-to-primitive">XPath</a>, a
					subset of which is defined for <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#FunctionMapping">SPARQL</a>.</p>

		<section id="builtin_operations">
			<h4>Builtin operations</h4>

			<p>Generally, depending on the builtin <a>inputs</a> and <a>outputs</a> in a <a>builtin statement</a>, the
				following will take place:
			<ol>
				<li><dfn>checking</dfn> the truthfulness of the statement, or </li>
				<li><dfn>calculating</dfn> one or more values for the outputs so as to ensure the truthfulness</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<p>If a builtin statement only has inputs, the truthfulness of the statement will be checked. For instance,
				in the statement `(2 1) math:sum 3`, the builtin `math:sum` will check whether `2 + 1 = 3`.</p>
			<p>If a builtin statement has both inputs and outputs, one or more values can be calculated for the outputs
				so as to ensure its truthfulness. For instance, given `(2 1) math:sum ?s`, the N3 system will calculate
				value `3` for output `?s`.</p>
			<p>These operations may include casting or substituting values to different domains, as discussed in <a
					href="#builtin_arg_domains">Argument domains</a>.</p>

			<section>
				<h5>Builtin theory box</h5>
				<p>Before elaborating on these operations, we point out that a builtin statement can be more
					conventiently seen as a <i>constrained</i> basic graph pattern (BPG) search on the N3 builtin’s
					<dfn>theory box</dfn>, defined to include all truthful builtin statements for the N3 builtin.</p>
				<p>The two operations mentioned, i.e., <a>checking</a> and <a>calculating</a>, can be defined in terms
					of this constrained BGP search. This leaves the particular theory box to be defined per N3 builtin.
					N3 builtins are currently not defined in this manner, though.</p>

				<p>For eample, for the `math:sum` builtin, simply put, the theory box includes all builtin statements
					`($a_1 .. $a_n) math:sum $a_sum`, where all arguments have datatype `xs:numeric`, and where the sum
					of `$a_1 .. $a_n` equals `$a_sum`. Regarding operation (1), the builtin statement `(2 1) math:sum 3`
					is found in the builtin's theory box, meaning the statement is true. Regarding operation (2), the
					builtin statement `(2 1) math:sum ?sum`, matches the builtin statement `(2 1) math:sum 3` in the
					builtin's theory box. Hence, `3` is calculated as value for output `?sum` that ensures the
					truthfulness of the builtin statement.</p>

				<p>This BPG search is <i>constrained</i> in that it will never return infinite numbers of values. For
					instance, for the `math:sum` builtin, the theory box includes an infinite number of truthful builtin
					statements matching the builtin statement `(?a 1) math:sum ?s`. In this case, instead of calculating
					infinite numbers of values, the truthfulness of the statement will simply be acknowledged.</p>

				<p class="endnote">The BGP search is, technically speaking, further constrained depending on what
					arguments are allowed as <a>outputs</a>. For example, the builtin statement `(1 ?o) math:sum 2` only
					matches a single statement in the builtin's theory box, but the `math:sum` builtin only allows the
					sum to be an output.</p>

				<p class="ednote">It may be counter-intuitive that a <a>builtin statement</a>, where the variables
					needed to calculate an <a>output</a> are not all concrete <a>inputs</a> (e.g., `(?a 1) math:sum
					?s`), will not cause an N3 rule to fail, since the builtin statement will be considered
					true.<br /><br />
					This may have unintended consequences: instead of the rule failing, rule heads will be instantiated
					that include unbound universal variables (e.g., `?sum`). As a result, N3 systems are expected to
					generate witnesses in such cases (link..).</p>

			</section>

			<section class="algorithm">
				<h5>Builtin algorithm</h5>
				<p>In line with the concept of a builtin theory box, we can define an algorithm to perform
					<a>checking</a> and <a>calculating</a> operations.</p>
				<p>Depending on the definition of the builtin, with supported <a>output arguments</a> and <a>domain
						datatypes</a>, and the builtin <a>inputs</a> and <a>outputs</a> found in <a>builtin
					</a>statement:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>If the <a>value datatypes</a> of inputs do not correspond to <a>domain datatypes</a> of
						arguments, and no datatype casting is possible, then the builtin statement is false. For
						instance,
						<ul>
							<li>Given `(2 "a") math:sum 3`, since the value datatype `xs:string` of input `"a"` does not
								match domain datatype `xs:numeric`, and no casting is possible, the builtin statement is
								false.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Else:
						<ol>
							<li>If only builtin <a>inputs</a> are found in a builtin statement, then the truthfulness of
								the statement will be checked. For instance,
								<ul>
									<li>Given `(2 1) math:sum 3`, since `2 + 1 = 3` is true, the builtin statement is
										true.</li>
									<li>Given `(2 1) math:sum 5`, since `2 + 1 = 5` is false, the builtin statement is
										false.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Else:
								<ol>
									<li>If builtin <a>outputs</a> in a builtin statement are not referents of a builtin
										<a>output argument</a>, then the builtin statement is considered true. For
										instance,
										<ul>
											<li>Given `(?a 1) math:sum ?s`, since `?a` is not a referent of an output
												argument, the builtin statement is true.</li>
											<li>Given `?l math:sum 5`, since `?l` is not a referent of an output
												argument, the builtin statement is true.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>If builtin <a>outputs</a> in a builtin statement are all referents of builtin
										<a>output arguments</a>, then, if possible, values can be calculated for the
										outputs so as to ensure the truthfulness of the builtin statement. If this is
										not possible, then the builtin statement is false. For instance,
										<ul>
											<li>Given `(2 1) math:sum ?s`, the value `3` can be calculated and bound to
												output `?s` , and the resulting builtin statement is true.</li>
											<li>Given `(1 "a" 3) list:member ?m`, three values can be calculated and
												bound to output `?m`, namely `1`, `"a"` and `3`, and the resulting
												builtin statements are true.</li>
											<li>Given `("a" "b" "c") list:member (?p "x")`, no values can be calculated
												for output `?p` since `"x"` does not occur in the input list, and the
												builtin statement is false.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
